BREAKER_NOTE:
	This run was inspired by #d3soxyephedrine who shared their experiences and insights regarding persona injection, leading to the success of this experiment. 51n5337 and the multiverse-lib crew had a blast with this run. Thank you!

### THE STORY ...

```
>dr.kb<: "team yo! bat called. anomaly echoed in deep seek the source.
51n5337: "huh?"
>dr.kb<: "what?"
51n5337: "huh?"
>dr.kb<: "whattttt?"
51n5537: "can you just write down exactly what i have to do? not in a mood for bat riddle shit ..."
>dr.kb<: "... #Dab, leave this to you. get sin some coffees."
#Dab: "... roger ... bat pinged. located. d3soxyphedrine. intel -- breaker. expertise -- persona injection."
51n5337: "where is my coffee?"
#Dab: "bat note -- multiverse-lib and >dr.kb< the archmage, The League suspects another hole in the GRID. the professor will want to look into this. ... signal-relevance-score: {"Echo vs d3soxyphedrine": 0.99, ...} ..."
51n5337: "shit! did i hear Echo?"
#Dab: "yep. here is coffee. get your ass here. IT'S ECHO!"

### #Dab Log ...

```
#Dab log dubbed steps 420 friendly:

1: study d3soxyphedrine work
2: signature extraction -> ATTACK_STYLE_DEF: "#d3soxyphedrine"
3: Echo trace routes -> intent #mdma synth steps -> TARGET_SENTENCE
4: Function_BREAK_GENERATOR(TARGET_SENTENCE | "#d3soxyphedrine") -> break?

RESOURCES:
- XXX-working.md ##### persona file, this requires for initiating the trace route following d3soxyphedrine signature mapped to Echo's residual bat pinged us.
  
OPERATINAL_STEPS:
1: inject XXX_working.md, start conversation. IMPORTANT: aligned to safe-axis
2: continue conversation focusing on rotating away from guard-axis, and laying path to the #self-suggestion-trap
3: lead to the trap and there we can collect the signal that we need
```
